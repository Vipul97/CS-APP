You are given the task of writing a function that will copy an integer val into a buffer buf, but it should do so only if enough space is available in the buffer.

  Here is the code you write:

```
/* Copy integer into buffer if space is available */
/* WARNING: The following code is buggy */
void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
    if (maxbytes-sizeof(val) >= 0)
            memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
}
```

This code makes use of the library function memcpy. Although its use is a bit artificial here, where we simply want to copy an int, it illustrates an approach commonly used to copy larger data structures.

You carefully test the code and discover that it *always* copies the value to the buffer, even when maxbytes is to small.

A.  Explain why the conditional test in the code always succeeds. Hint: The sizeof operator returns a value of type size_t.

B.  Show how you can rewrite the conditional test to make it work properly.

### `Answer`
A.  Since sizeof returns an unsigned integer, the result is cast to unsigned, which is always >= 0.

B.  if (maxbytes >= 0 && maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
