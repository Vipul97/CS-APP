Suppose we are given the task of generating code to multiply integer variable x by various different constant factors K. To be efficient, we want to use only the operations +, -, and <<. For the following values of K, write C expressions to perform the multiplication using at most three operations per expression.

A.  K = 17

B.  K = -7

C.  K = 60

D.  K = -112

### `Answer`
A.  K = (x << 4) + x;

B.  K = x - (x << 3);

C.  K = (x << 6) - (x << 2);

D.  K = (x << 4) - (x << 7);
